And here we go!
Setting up the place where i'll be able to mind-dump from time to time!
This does not pretend to be a corporative blog or anything like this, but a site where i'll be able to recover my sanity :D

Code snipet sample:
{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Sample links:
I have read a lot of webs to be able to set this up, some of them:
[This gist][jekyll-gist]
This [_config.yml][config-yml] file from the theme webpage
The list of [dependencies][github-pages-dependencies] of github pages


[jekyll-gist]: https://gist.github.com/widdowquinn/f255783f826f358f5de97186131419a9
